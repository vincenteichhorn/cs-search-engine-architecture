Document: "Related Articles What Time of the Year Does Honeysuckle Bloom? Honeysuckle With Yellowing Leaves Why Are Honeysuckle Vines Dying? How do I Identify Japanese Honeysuckle vs. American Honeysuckle? One hundred eighty different species of honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) -- considered invasive in some states -- exist, as well as other plants with the common name honeysuckle that add color and fragrance to your yard as a fast-growing vine or shrub. The small, trumpet-shaped flowers may be white, yellow, pink, red or orange depending on species. That color and fragrance are only possible though, if your honeysuckle blooms. This aggressive grower is usually relatively problem-free, but a few things can impede flowering. Know Your Honeysuckle Honeysuckle species don't all bloom at the same time. A honeysuckle that doesn't bloom may just not have bloomed yet. Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) is an early summer bloomer, with purple-tinged white flowers that fade to yellow in U. S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 4 through 10. Coral honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervivens), suitable for USDA zones 4 through 9, doesn't bloom until late summer through fall, while Cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis) blooms from fall into winter in zones 9 through 11 in scarlet, orange, apricot or yellow, depending on species. Aside from knowing the bloom time of your species, the age of individual plants is also important. A honeysuckle that is less than 3 years old may not be mature enough to produce flowers. Let the Sun Shine Honeysuckles are generally listed as being suitable for areas in full sun to partial shade. While relatively little affects the production of the evergreen foliage of these rampant growers, honeysuckles planted in full sun have the most flowers. ""Full sun"" is considered to be six or more hours of sun per day. Sunlight doesn't need to be constant over that time, but it should add up to a minimum of six hours -- the more the better for honeysuckles. Hold the Fertilizer Honeysuckle grows so well that little or no fertilizer is necessary in most cases. This is especially true of fertilizers with a high proportion of nitrogen. Excess nitrogen leads to lush foliage, and few or no flowers. Some sources recommend fertilizing honeysuckle lightly in early spring and again in the middle of its blooming season if plants show poor overall growth. Apply a product such as a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus 5-10-5 fertilizer at a rate of 1 cup per plant around the root zone of the honeysuckle and water in well. Time Pruning Right Cutting your honeysuckle back at the wrong time or extensively can inhibit blooming as well. Japanese honeysuckle blooms on the current season's growth, but usually only needs pruning if it has outgrown its bounds or has become leggy at the bottom. Prune it in late winter to early spring. You may also want to shear off faded flowers to prevent self seeding to mitigate its invasive tendencies. Common honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) blooms on side shoots that grew the previous season in USDA zones 5 through 9. Pruning this variety in the spring would eliminate flowers. Wait until after it blooms, then cut back one-third of the plant. Honeysuckles that have been renovated -- cut back hard to renew growth from the base up -- may not flower for a few seasons as they recover.
